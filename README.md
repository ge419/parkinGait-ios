# **parkinGait-ios**

parkinGait is an iOS application designed to monitor and analyze gait patterns for individuals with Parkinsonâ€™s disease. The app utilizes the iPhone's built-in sensors, such as the accelerometer and gyroscope, to calculate step length, step count, and other gait-related metrics. It offers multiple algorithms for gait analysis and supports exporting data for further research and analysis.

## **Features**
- **Step Length Tracking**: Tracks and calculates step length using different algorithms.
- **Step Counting**: Counts steps and calculates total distance traveled.
- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Displays acceleration and step length data in interactive charts.
- **Data Export(Under Development)**: Export collected gait data (accelerometer, gyroscope, and step length) to a CSV file for further analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy interaction and tracking.

## **Core Components**
### **Gait Tracking Models**
1. **Step Counter**: Tracks steps and distance using peak detection on accelerometer data.
2. **Step Length Calculator**: Calculates step length using device IMU sensors.
3. **Step Length with Height**: Calculates step length by factoring in user height and stride frequency.

### **Data Export(Under Development)**
- Export gait data (timestamp, accelerometer, gyroscope, and step length) to a CSV file.
- Save and share files via the Files app, email, or other apps using the iOS share sheet.

### **Interactive Visualization**
- Charts displaying real-time acceleration data or step length measurement.
- Step length visualizations for better insight into gait performance.
